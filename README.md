# Welcome

Daishi RPG is a [sword and sorcery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_and_sorcery) style role playing game based on
 an 
original world concept. Players will take on the role of Daishians and explore the world in hopes of completing personal
goals and uncovering the mysteries in store for them.

## The World Overview

Daishi is a world with a deep and mysterious history spread across several Ages. The current Age for this campaign is
the Imperial age which is characterized by the wide spread rule of the Solarian empire. The world has been at moderate
peace for several hundred years and the Solarian empire is seen as an absolute authority for most of the world. 

## Daishians

The word "Daishian" is used to both describe anyone living in Daishi and also a person with a certain "synergistic"
power. A Daishi may be able to control temperature, gravity, motion, light, time, and even life itself. Most Daishians
can only control a single "force" but there are rare cases of Daishians being able to control two or more forces. A
Daishian that can can control all forces is known as an "Omni". 
 
Power holding Daishians make up roughly one tenth of the population. Daishian powers tend to run in families but the
likelihood of being Daishian seems to be unrelated to race, family, and location.   

While "Daishian" can be used to describe anyone, the colloquial convention is to only refer to synergistic power holders
as "Daishian". A person that has no powers is called a "scrub."

## Scrubs

A "Scrub" is a non power holding person and is by far the most common type of person on Daishi. The term "scrub" was 
once a derogatory slang but has since been adopted as a common name. In very formal settings "scrub" is still considered
impolite and the more proper term "Common" is preferred. For example, the Imperial council has "Common" seats that can
only be held by a Scrub.
 
## Synergy

[Synergy](synergies) is, for lack of a better word, the "magic" of Daishi. A Daishian will have synergy with one or more of the
natural forces. The strength of this synergy allows greater control and awareness of their respective forces. A scrub
is simply a person with no synergies. 

Unlike magic in most settings, Synergy is not believed to be granted by a deity or supernatural entity. Instead, Synergy
is viewed as a natural extension of nature. It can be measured and observed, and it acts consistently under the laws of 
nature. It is widely believed that synergistic energy comes from either the Sun or Daishi itself.  

Daishians can both store and channel Synergistic energy. In the Fantasy AGE system, this energy store translates 
directly to MP. Daishians naturally regain MP overtime. Synergistic power can also be stored and/or enhanced with 
items known as Opsiates.
