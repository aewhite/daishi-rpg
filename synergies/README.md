# Synergy

Synergy is the name given to the power that a Daishian uses to control the world around them. Synergy allows a 
Daishian to manipulate one or more forces. 

A force usually comes in pairs and a Daishian can usually control both aspects of the force; however, most Daishians 
specialize on one side the force. For example, a Daishian with the ability to control temperature will by able to both 
heat and cool objects around them, but they will probably special in either creating super heated infernos or making 
bocks of ice in the middle of summer.
